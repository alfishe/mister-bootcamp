# Buildroot Overview

MiSTer's root filesystem is built with Buildroot — the embedded Linux build system that generates a minimal, reproducible cross-compilation toolchain and a compressed initramfs archive in a single `make` invocation. This article covers Buildroot's architecture as applied to MiSTer: the defconfig model, the package selection framework, the output structure, the rootfs overlay mechanism, and the toolchain bootstrap process.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an **architectural overview** of Buildroot itself. For the full step-by-step MiSTer build pipeline (workspace setup, kernel compilation, SD card image assembly), see the companion guide at [Buildroot Linux for DE10-Nano — Comprehensive](../Buildroot%20Linux%20for%20DE10-Nano%20-%20Comprehensive.md).

## 1. Why Buildroot?

General-purpose Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Yocto) are too large and too slow for MiSTer's requirements:

| Constraint | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Minimal footprint** | The entire rootfs must fit in DDR3 RAM alongside the FPGA core. MiSTer's initramfs is ~8 MB compressed. |
| **Deterministic boot** | A fixed set of packages eliminates unpredictable service startup times. MiSTer's `Main` binary must be on-screen within seconds. |
| **Power-loss resilience** | The rootfs runs entirely from RAM (embedded in `zImage` via `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE`). SD card corruption from sudden power-off only affects the read-write `/media/fat/` data partition. |
| **Reproducible builds** | A pinned Buildroot version + defconfig produces bit-identical rootfs archives. Critical for CI/CD (mr-fusion's Docker pipeline). |
| **Single cross-toolchain** | Buildroot bootstraps one toolchain that compiles both user-space packages **and** the Linux kernel. No external Linaro/CodeSourcery toolchain needed. |

## 2. Architecture: The Defconfig Model

Buildroot's configuration is driven by a single `.config` file, typically generated from a **defconfig** (a minimal set of non-default options). The defconfig is a flat list of `BR2_*=y`/`BR2_*=*value*` assignments — it is **not** a Kconfig fragment file.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    D["defconfig<br/>(mr-fusion_defconfig)"] -->|"make mr-fusion_defconfig"| DOT["full .config<br/>(all options resolved)"]
    DOT -->|"make -j(nproc)"| TC["Cross Toolchain<br/>arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-"]
    DOT -->|"make -j(nproc)"| PKG["User-space Packages<br/>(BusyBox, p7zip, exfatprogs, fbv)"]
    DOT -->|"make -j(nproc)"| CPIO["rootfs.cpio<br/>(compressed initramfs)"]
```

### 2.1 Defconfig Lifecycle

1. **Inject:** The mr-fusion defconfig is copied into Buildroot's `configs/` directory:

   ```bash
   cp mr-fusion/builder/config/buildroot-defconfig \
      buildroot/configs/mr-fusion_defconfig
   ```

   Source: `mr-fusion/builder/config/buildroot-defconfig`

2. **Resolve:** `make mr-fusion_defconfig` expands the minimal defconfig into a full `.config` with all Kconfig defaults applied.

3. **Build:** `make -j$(nproc)` executes the resolved configuration.

### 2.2 Key Defconfig Variables

Extracted from the mr-fusion defconfig with Buildroot ≥ 2024.08:

```ini
# Target architecture: ARM Cortex-A9 with hard-float NEON
BR2_arm=y
BR2_cortex_a9=y
BR2_ARM_ENABLE_NEON=y
BR2_ARM_FPU_NEON=y

# Toolchain features
BR2_CCACHE=y
BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_WCHAR=y
BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_CXX=y

# System identity
BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_HOSTNAME="mr-fusion"
BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ISSUE="Welcome to Mr. Fusion"

# Rootfs overlay (first-boot install script)
BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY="board/mr-fusion/rootfs-overlay"

# Packages
BR2_PACKAGE_P7ZIP=y
BR2_PACKAGE_EXFATPROGS=y          # replaces deprecated EXFAT / EXFAT_UTILS
BR2_PACKAGE_UTIL_LINUX=y
BR2_PACKAGE_UTIL_LINUX_BINARIES=y
BR2_PACKAGE_FBV=y                 # framebuffer image viewer (splash screen)
BR2_PACKAGE_FBV_PNG=y
BR2_PACKAGE_FBV_JPEG=y
BR2_PACKAGE_FBV_GIF=y

# Output format
BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_CPIO=y
BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_CPIO_GZIP=y
# BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_TAR is not set
```

Source: `mr-fusion/builder/config/buildroot-defconfig`

> [!WARNING]
> When using Buildroot **2024.08 or newer**, the `BR2_PACKAGE_EXFAT` and `BR2_PACKAGE_EXFAT_UTILS` options no longer exist. The mr-fusion defconfig must use `BR2_PACKAGE_EXFATPROGS=y` instead. Using the old defconfig with a modern Buildroot causes a configuration error. If you must pin an older Buildroot (e.g. the official mr-fusion-pinned `2024.02.1`), keep the original `BR2_PACKAGE_EXFAT=y` and `BR2_PACKAGE_EXFAT_UTILS=y`.

---

## 3. Package Model

Buildroot's package system is organized as a set of `.mk` files under `package/<name>/`. Each package defines:

| Descriptor | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `*_VERSION` | Upstream source version |
| `*_SITE` | Download URL |
| `*_DEPENDENCIES` | Build-order dependencies |
| `*_CONFIGURE_CMDS` | Configuration commands |
| `*_BUILD_CMDS` | Build commands |
| `*_INSTALL_CMDS` | Installation into staging/target |

MiSTer's mr-fusion configuration enables only the packages essential for the HPS control plane:

| Package | Role in MiSTer |
|---|---|
| **BusyBox** | Shell, coreutils, init — the entire userspace foundation |
| **p7zip** | Extracts `release_*.7z` archives during first-boot install |
| **exfatprogs** | `mkfs.exfat` and `fsck.exfat` for the `/media/fat/` data partition |
| **util-linux** | `mount`, `fdisk`, `blkid` — used by the S99install-MiSTer.sh script |
| **fbv** | Framebuffer image viewer — displays the splash screen (`splash.png`) during boot |

> [!NOTE]
> **No glibc — uClibc-ng by default.** Buildroot's internal toolchain targets uClibc-ng for minimal footprint. The MiSTer `Main` binary (`Main_MiSTer`) is statically linked, so it does not depend on the Buildroot libc at runtime. This is deliberate: the HPS binary is a single fat ELF that can be swapped independently of the rootfs.

### 3.1 Package Selection Philosophy

MiSTer's package list is deliberately **sparse**:

- **No Python, no Perl, no Lua.** All scripting is handled by BusyBox ash + shell scripts (`S99install-MiSTer.sh`, `wifi.sh`).
- **No systemd.** Buildroot defaults to BusyBox `init` (`BR2_INIT_BUSYBOX=y`). MiSTer's boot sequence is a simple `/etc/inittab` → `/etc/init.d/rcS` → numbered scripts.
- **No X11/Wayland.** The menu and OSD are rendered by `Main_MiSTer` directly to the Linux framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`) via the `fbv` package for the splash screen; the OSD itself is drawn pixel-by-pixel through the HPS-FPGA bridge.

---

## 4. Output Structure

After `make -j$(nproc)`, Buildroot writes all output under `output/`:

```
buildroot/output/
├── build/              # Per-package build directories (sources unpacked + compiled)
│   ├── busybox-1.36.1/
│   ├── p7zip-17.04/
│   └── ...
├── host/               # Host tools and cross-compiler
│   ├── bin/
│   │   ├── arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
│   │   ├── arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-ld
│   │   └── ...
│   └── usr/
├── images/             # Final output artifacts
│   └── rootfs.cpio     # ← The critical artifact: compressed initramfs
├── staging/            # Sysroot for cross-compilation (headers + libraries)
└── target/             # The complete rootfs tree (before cpio archiving)
```

### 4.1 The rootfs.cpio Archive

`rootfs.cpio` is the **only** Buildroot artifact consumed by the downstream kernel build. It contains:

- `/bin/busybox` (multi-call binary — shell, init, mount, etc.)
- `/etc/inittab` and `/etc/init.d/rcS` (BusyBox init scripts)
- `/etc/init.d/S99install-MiSTer.sh` (from the rootfs overlay — see §5)
- `/usr/bin/7z` (p7zip extraction)
- `/sbin/mkfs.exfat`, `/sbin/fsck.exfat` (exfatprogs)
- `/lib/` (uClibc-ng shared libraries)

The cpio archive is embedded into the kernel `zImage` via the kernel defconfig directive:

```ini
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE="../buildroot/output/images/rootfs.cpio"
```

This creates a self-contained boot image — the entire OS loads into RAM at boot. After init, only the `/media/fat/` data partition (mounted from the SD card's third partition) is read-write.

## 5. Rootfs Overlay Mechanism

Buildroot's `BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY` directive copies arbitrary files into the rootfs **after** all packages are installed but **before** the cpio archive is generated. This is how MiSTer injects its custom first-boot install script.

### 5.1 Overlay Layout

```
board/mr-fusion/rootfs-overlay/
└── etc/
    └── init.d/
        └── S99install-MiSTer.sh    # First-boot installer
```

The overlay tree mirrors the target rootfs structure exactly. Every file under the overlay directory is copied verbatim into the corresponding location in `output/target/`.

### 5.2 The S99install-MiSTer.sh Script

This is MiSTer's **first-boot installer** — a BusyBox ash script that runs once when a freshly imaged SD card boots:

1. Mounts the FAT32 boot partition (`/dev/mmcblk0p1`)
2. Extracts `release_*.7z` via `7z` (p7zip)
3. Repartitions the SD card to create the full-size exFAT `MiSTer_Data` partition
4. Overwrites the factory `bootloader.img` with the MiSTer-patched `uboot.img`
5. Sets up the `linux/` directory structure (`/media/fat/linux/`)
6. Self-deletes (`rm /etc/init.d/S99install-MiSTer.sh`) to prevent re-execution on subsequent boots

Source: `mr-fusion/builder/scripts/S99install-MiSTer.sh`

> [!CAUTION]
> The S99install script overwrites the **raw 0xA2 bootloader partition** with `uboot.img` from the MiSTer release archive. If this step fails or is interrupted, the DE10-Nano will not boot on the next power cycle. Always verify that `uboot.img` is present in the release archive before assembling the SD card image.

---

## 6. Cross-Toolchain Bootstrap

Buildroot's internal toolchain is one of its most valuable features for MiSTer. Rather than downloading a pre-built Linaro GCC, Buildroot compiles the toolchain from source:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BR as Buildroot make
    participant SRC as Source tarballs
    participant BIN as binutils
    participant G1 as GCC (stage 1)
    participant KL as Kernel headers
    participant LC as uClibc-ng
    participant G2 as GCC (stage 2)

    BR->>SRC: Download binutils, GCC, uClibc-ng, linux-headers
    BR->>BIN: Build binutils (arm-buildroot-...-as, ld, objcopy)
    BR->>G1: Build GCC stage 1 (no libc — can only compile kernels)
    BR->>KL: Install Linux kernel headers
    BR->>LC: Build uClibc-ng (using stage 1 GCC + headers)
    BR->>G2: Build GCC stage 2 (with libc — full C/C++ compiler)
    Note over BR,G2: Toolchain ready at output/host/bin/
```

The resulting toolchain triplet depends on the FPU setting:
- `BR2_ARM_FPU_NEON=y` → `arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-` (hard-float)
- `BR2_ARM_FPU_VFPV2=y` (legacy) → `arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabi-` (soft-float)

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not hardcode the toolchain prefix.** Different Buildroot versions and FPU settings produce different triplets. Always resolve dynamically:
> ```bash
> _TC=$(ls buildroot/output/host/bin/arm-*-gnueabi*-gcc | head -n1)
> export CROSS_COMPILE="${_TC%gcc}"
> ```

## 7. Buildroot's Role in the MiSTer Build Pipeline

Buildroot is the **first stage** of the three-stage MiSTer build pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph S1["Stage 1: Buildroot"]
        direction TB
        DEF["mr-fusion_defconfig"] --> MAKE["make -j(nproc)"]
        MAKE --> CPIO["rootfs.cpio"]
        MAKE --> TC["Cross Toolchain"]
    end

    subgraph S2["Stage 2: Kernel"]
        direction TB
        TC --> KMAKE["make ARCH=arm<br/>CROSS_COMPILE=..."]
        CPIO -->|"CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE"| KMAKE
        KMAKE --> ZI["zImage<br/>(kernel + initramfs)"]
        KMAKE --> DTB["socfpga_cyclone5_socdk.dtb"]
    end

    subgraph S3["Stage 3: Packaging"]
        direction TB
        ZI --> IMG["genimage / dd"]
        DTB --> IMG
        IMG --> SD["sdcard.img<br/>(FAT32 boot + 0xA2 raw)"]
    end
```

The critical dependency: **Stage 2 (kernel build) depends on Stage 1's cross-toolchain and rootfs.cpio**. You cannot build the MiSTer kernel without first completing the Buildroot build.

## 8. Antipatterns and Hazards

### 8.1 Do NOT Use `make menuconfig` to Configure

Buildroot's `make menuconfig` opens an interactive ncurses interface. This is useful for **exploration** but should never be used to generate the defconfig for production:

- **Problem:** `menuconfig` writes a full `.config` with every option expanded. Saving this as a defconfig produces a bloated file that breaks across Buildroot versions.
- **Correct approach:** Use `make savedefconfig` to extract only the non-default options into a minimal defconfig.

### 8.2 Do NOT Cross-Contaminate Buildroot Versions

The `output/` directory is **not** portable across Buildroot versions. If you upgrade Buildroot (e.g. from 2024.02 to 2026.02), you must:

```bash
make clean    # or: rm -rf output/
make mr-fusion_defconfig
make -j$(nproc)
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Mixing a Buildroot 2024.02 `output/` directory with Buildroot 2026.02 binaries produces silent corruption — packages will link against stale libraries from the old sysroot, producing binaries that crash at runtime with `SIGILL` or `SIGSEGV`.

### 8.3 Do NOT Use External Toolchains (for the Buildroot Image Build)

MiSTer's mr-fusion defconfig uses `BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y` (internal toolchain). Switching to an external toolchain (`BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL=y`) for the **Buildroot image build** breaks the guarantee that the toolchain and sysroot are internally consistent. The internal toolchain is compiled specifically for the target's uClibc-ng version, kernel headers version, and FPU configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> This warning applies **only** to the Buildroot rootfs/kernel build. The `Main_MiSTer` binary itself is built separately using the MiSTer project's pre-built external ARM GCC 10.2 toolchain — a different build process with different constraints. Do not confuse the two.

---

## 9. Platform Context

| Platform | Build System | Rootfs | Kernel Build |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MiSTer (DE10-Nano)** | Buildroot (internal toolchain) | cpio initramfs embedded in zImage | Cross-compiled with Buildroot GCC |
| **Analogue Pocket (openFPGA)** | Proprietary (Intel SoC EDS) | N/A — bare-metal ARM binary | N/A — no Linux on HPS |
| **MiST / SiDi** | N/A — no HPS | N/A | N/A |
| **MiSTeX** | Buildroot or Yocto (board-dependent) | Varies by SBC (ext4 on eMMC common) | Board BSP kernel |
| **Software Emulation (RetroArch)** | Host OS package manager | Host OS rootfs | N/A |

MiSTer's approach — Buildroot → cpio → initramfs embedded in zImage — is optimized for the single-board, power-cycle-heavy use case of a game console. The entire OS lives in RAM; only user data touches the SD card. This is fundamentally different from MiSTeX's approach (where the SBC runs a full Linux with persistent storage) and Analogue Pocket's approach (where there is no HPS Linux at all).
